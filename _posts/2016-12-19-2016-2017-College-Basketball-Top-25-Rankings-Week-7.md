Another week of college basketball is in the books and after a great weekend of games, we have a new early favorite for game of the year as Kentucky outlasted UNC 103-100 in Las Vegas. All of the top teams took care of business this week except for Indiana who fell to Butler in the Crossroads Classic.

With the holidays approaching, this week is the last main week of non-conference play and there are still quite a few good games left to be played. There are certainly some good opportunities for teams to bolster their resume and help wrack up wins for the conference that could help their league as a whole when March rolls around.

### 1. Villanova Wildcats
Villanova took down a pretty good Temple team with ease and now the Wildcats just have to get by American to head into Big East play undefeated and ready to prove they're the top team once again.

### 2. Baylor Bears
Baylor had two below 250 KenPom teams and a non-D1 team this week and the Bears did what they needed to do and really showed off on the defensive end as they held each team under 60 points. The Bears have one more cupcake this week before heading into Big 12 play undefeated, which I doubt anyone saw coming.

### 3. UCLA Bruins
The Bruins got a good win over Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic and with Kentucky's win over UNC in the very next game, UCLA's win at Rupp Arena looks even more impressive. Lonzo Ball has been great and as TJ Leaf continues to get better and the supporting cast starts to fill in, UCLA could end up being the best team in the Pac 12 by far.

### 4. Duke Blue Devils
Duke didn't have a game this week, but the added rest should help the Blue Devils quite a bit. We could see the debut of Harry Giles on Monday against Tennessee State and if so, this Duke team might finally have their full squad. The ACC is going to be a battle, but Duke is still probably the favorite to win the league going in.

### 5. Kansas Jayhawks
Davidson gave the Jayhawks a scare in the first half, but if you just looked at the final score you could hardly tell. I really wish we could run back that game vs Duke to see who deserves to be on top now. Kansas still hasn't lost since the first game of the year and will only continue to improve as Josh Jackson figures out his game.

### 6. Kentucky Wildcats
So, Malik Monk is really good at basketball. The Kentucky guard scored 47 points against UNC in an impressive offensive shootout. Kentucky's defense might be a concern, but it's a little too early to start saying that since they gave up so many points in an uptempo game against another very good offensive team.

### 7. Gonzaga Bulldogs
It wasn't pretty, but the Bulldogs held off Tennessee in what was practically a road game to get another good win and remain undefeated on the year. I'm not sure I can call this Gonzaga team a Final Four contender like so many other have, but there's no doubting that they're really good and will only get better in WCC play.

### 8. Louisville Cardinals
Louisville beat up on Eastern Kentucky team to set up a top 10 match-up with their rival Kentucky in the middle of the week. Hosting the Wildcats should help the Cardinals a little bit, but regardless of the outcome, Louisville will have to face Virginia just a week later.

### 9. North Carolina Tar Heels
Despite the loss, North Carolina now has Joel Berry back and it clearly made a big difference against Kentucky. The Tar Heels suffered another tough loss in an instant classic game, but Justin Jackson played great, despite being overshadowed by Malik Monk's 47 points.

### 10. Wisconsin Badgers
The Badgers keep moving up with an easy win over Green Bay. Wisconsin now has over a week off before the face Florida A&M. If it was any other team, maybe the Badgers should be worried about the long break, but Florida A&M is one of the worst teams in the country and Wisconsin can count on going into Big 10 play 11-2.

#### 11. Purdue Boilermakers

#### 12. Virginia Cavaliers

#### 13. West Virginia Mountaineers

#### 14. Creighton Bluejays

#### 15. Xavier Musketeers

#### 16. Arizona Wildcats

#### 17. Butler Bulldogs

#### 18. Indiana Hoosiers

#### 19. Saint Mary's Gaels

#### 20. Florida State Seminoles

#### 21. USC Trojans

#### 22. Oregon Ducks

#### 23. South Carolina Gamecocks

#### 24. Cincinnati Bearcats

#### 25. Florida Gators

##### Next Five:
- Notre Dame Fighting Irish
- Maryland Terrapins
- Texas Tech Red Raiders
- Oklahoma State Cowboys
- Clemson Tigers

My rankings might not have changed a lot this week, but that's sure to change soon as we get into conference play and teams will be playing other good teams much more frequently. With just a week left in non-conference play, a few teams need to make a late push to earn key wins that could help them or hurt them when March rolls around and the Selection Committee is trying to decide on 68 team for the NCAA Tournament.

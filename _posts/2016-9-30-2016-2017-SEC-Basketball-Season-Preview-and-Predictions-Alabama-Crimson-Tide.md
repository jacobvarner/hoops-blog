### Overview
Avery Johnson is coming into year two at Alabama with a few more weapons and a first full recruiting class to call his own. Alabama managed to bring in just one High School recruit and one Junior College transfer, but both are solid pickups and will likely help contribute their fair share this season.

In today's day in age, standard recruiting definitely isn't the only way to add new talent and Avery Johnson sure took advantage of the transfer market this offseason. Alongside Braxton Key and Ar'Mond Davis, four other newcomers will be joining in on the action this season. Nick King from Memphis and Avery Johnson Jr. will be taking the floor this season after sitting out last season due to transfer rules. Corban Collins and Bola Olaniyan will get to see immediate action after graduating from Morehead State and Southern Illinois last year.

The six newcomers join a cast of solid returning players. Riley Norris returns as the Crimson Tide's leader in 3PM and rebounds. Shannon Hale will be Alabama's leading returning scorer after averaging 10.8 PPG behind Retin Obasohan's 17.6 PPG. Hale won't necessarily be able to make up for the absence of Obasohan on his own, but he should have enough help from the likes of Dazon Ingram, Braxton Key, Ar'Mond Davis, and Nick King.

Alabama's offense should be in good enough shape this season, but the defense will be slightly improved, especially down low. Jimmie Taylor and Donta Hall return this season after finishing first and second on the team in blocks last season with 1.8 BPG and 1.7 BPG respectively. Along with retaining shot blockers from last season Alabama also returns and gains a lot of size. Most of the players who will see action are listed at 6'5" or taller and there are a handful of players inching closer to 7 feet. It might look different than watching Obasohan power to the hoop, but size is never a bad thing.

Avery Johnson didn't get quite the home run recruiting class that Alabama hoped after having Terrance Ferguson committed at one point, but the Crimson Tide still managed to bring in enough talent to avoid a drop off and likely will improve slightly in year two for Avery Johnson.

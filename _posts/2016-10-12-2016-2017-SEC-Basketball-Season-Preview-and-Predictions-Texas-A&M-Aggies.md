### Overview
Last season the Aggies were led by Danuel House, Jalen Jones, and Alex Caruso and made it all the way to the Sweet 16 before eventually being knocked out by Buddy Hield and Oklahoma. This year, Texas A&M might not have quite the talent of last season's team especially after JJ Caldwell was ruled ineligible, but the Aggies won't be taking too big of a step back, if at all.

Billy Kennedy established the Aggies as a solid second team in the SEC last season and Texas A&M should be right back in a similar position this season. While losing talent such as House, Jones, and Caruso will surely sting a little, especially in the early parts of the season, the Aggies return some top talent with Tyler Davis, DJ Hogg, and Admon Gilder along with some newcomers that could contribute immediately.

Tyler Davis will be one of the best big men in the SEC this season. Last year as a freshman the 6'10" center averaged 11.3 PPG and 6.3 RPG and those numbers will certainly increase this season. Davis isn't the only post player that the Aggies will have as Billy Kennedy has quite a sizable team this season. Alongside Davis, Texas A&M also has 6'9" forward DJ Hogg and 6'10" center Tonny Trocha-Morelos returning with newcomers 6'9" forward Robert Williams and 6'11" forward Eric Vila joining as well. Add in bigger guards such as 6'5" Kobie Eubanks and 6'4" Admon Gilder and the Aggies will surely be able to match the size of almost any team in the SEC and probably any team in the country as well.

Rebounds and defense shouldn't be a problem for the Aggies this season mainly due to their size, but Texas A&M will need to find a few scoring threats to replace House and Jones who were the top two scorers last season. Davis should put up a few more points down low, but they'll need the guards to score from outside as well. JC Hampton averaged nearly 16 PPG last season for Lipscomb while shooting 40% from the field and 35% from deep. He'll likely be competing with Admon Gilder for the starting point guard position, but while simultaneously distributing the basketball between the bigs, whoever starts at point guard will also have to contribute a fair amount of points as well. Kobie Eubanks, a former 4-star commit, should finally start showing his talent this season after a transferring from Alabama and joining the Aggies last spring.

Getting to the Sweet 16 two years in a row will be quite difficult, but with the quality depth down low and a handful of quality guards, Texas A&M should be able to stay near the top of the SEC standings. If JC Hampton can be a real leader this year and Eubanks and Gilder step up in the back court, A&M could be dancing once again at the end of the year with hopes of going deep into March.

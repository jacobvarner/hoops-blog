This is the first time that I've done anything like this and boy was it harder than I expected. I went in with a list of key players from each team based on my individual previews of each team, and thought I would easily be able to categorize them into just a few teams. I decided to keep it true to basketball and selected two guards, two forwards, and one extra player for each of the three teams. The All-Freshman team is then comprised of the best Freshman that didn't make any of the other three teams.

Because I filled up these four teams and then still felt like there were several players that deserved to be mentioned, I then went and added a list of honorable mentions. In comparison, the official All-SEC teams at the end of last season had three separate teams of eight players each. To cap it all off I picked a Player of the Year, a Freshman of the Year, and a Coach of the Year. With all those details out there, here are my All-SEC picks:

### First Team All-SEC

**Dusty Hannahs**, Arkansas

**J.J. Frazier**, Georgia

**Malik Monk**, Kentucky

**Tyler Davis**, Texas A&M

**Bam Adebayo**, Kentucky

### Second Team All-SEC

**Danjel Purifoy**, Auburn

**De'Aaron Fox**, Kentucky

**Quinndary Weatherspoon**, Mississippi State

**Yante Maten**, Georgia

**Luke Kornet**, Vanderbilt

### Third Team All-SEC

**Dazon Ingram**, Alabama

**Antonio Blakeney**, LSU

**KeVaughn Allen**, Florida

**Moses Kingsley**, Arkansas

**John Egbunu**, Florida

### All-Freshman Team

**Mustapha Heron**, Auburn

**Mario Kegler**, Mississippi State

**Sacha Killeya-Jones**, Kentucky

**Wenyen Gabriel**, Kentucky

**Schnider Herard**, Mississippi State

### Honorable Mentions

**Jaylon Barford**, Arkansas

**Horace Spencer**, Auburn

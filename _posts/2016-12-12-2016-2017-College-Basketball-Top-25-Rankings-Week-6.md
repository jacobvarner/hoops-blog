Villanova remains my top team with a close, comeback road win over Notre Dame to give the Irish their first loss. The Wildcats have a 16 game winning streak dating back to last year, but there are a handful of other top teams waiting for Villanova to slip up so that a new team can take the top spot. Baylor remains unbeaten with one of the best resumes so far this season. After the Bears, there are five other undefeated teams and all seven unbeaten teams are currently in my top 25.

There just a few weeks left of non-conference play then things really get interesting, especially in the big leagues like the ACC and Big 12. A lot of teams still have major games left on their non-conference schedules and then several teams are just hoping to win out until conference play to keep themselves in good position to make a run at a NCAA Tournament appearance in March. I'm finally on Christmas break and I can't wait to fully enjoy the rest of college basketball non-conference play and head into conference matchups.

### 1. Villanova Wildcats
In Villanova's 74-66 win over Notre Dame, Josh Hart finished with 37 points, 11 rebounds, and 4 assists. Hart has been the best player in college basketball so far and it's fitting that he's on the best team in the country up to this point. The Wildcats have just two more games, against Temple and American, that separate them from going into Big East play undefeated and ready to re-state their claim as the best team in the league.

### 2. Baylor Bears
Baylor didn't have a game this week and won't play until Wednesday of this week. The Bears certainly deserve the break and will have a far easier remaining non-conference schedule as they look to finish unbeaten going into the Big 12 where they hope to challenge Kansas and finally dethrone the Jayhawks as the dominant Big 12 champs for over a decade.

### 3. UCLA Bruins
UCLA followed up their huge win over Kentucky last week with a 102-84 victory over Michigan at home in a wonderful environment in Pauley Pavilion. Lonzo Ball continues to be fantastic, but as TJ Leaf starts to heat up and Ike Anigbogu is stepping up down low, the Bruins might just be able to be the best team in the Pac 12.

### 4. Duke Blue Devils
Grayson Allen sure looked healthy in Duke's 49 point win over UNLV in Las Vegas. Allen scored 34 points and the Blue Devils are starting to look like the team most people expected at the beginning of the year. Harry Giles still isn't back and it's looking like Duke could be even better than previously expected.

### 5. Kansas Jayhawks
Yes, I'm aware that Kansas beat Duke at the beginning of the season, but that was a Duke team that was banged up and still missing two key freshman. Kansas is still a top team, but I'm not convinced that if the Blue Devils and the Jayhawks met on a neutral court this week that Kansas would win a second time.

### 6. Gonzaga Bulldogs
With Saint Mary's losing this week, Gonzaga is now sitting alone as the best WCC team. The Bulldogs have six wins over KenPom top 100 teams including three top 30 wins. As one of the seven remaining unbeaten teams, Gonzaga may have the best chance of staying unbeaten the longest.

### 7. Kentucky Wildcats
Kentucky hasn't quite been the team they were before the loss to UCLA, but I know the Wildcats will come around again soon. Led by Malik Monk and De'Aaron Fox, the Wildcats just have too much talent not to be considered one of the top teams. No one in the SEC looks like they'll be able to truly challenge Kentucky so far so if the Wildcats can make it through the gauntlet that is UNC and Louisville in the next few weeks, look out.

### 8. Louisville Cardinals
Speaking of Louisville, the Cardinals are right behind the Wildcats in my top 25. Louisville has the best defense in the country according to KenPom and they're only loss came at the hands of Baylor. Louisville may not have the talent to go toe to toe with Kentucky, but they'll get to play at home when the Wildcats come to town and could get their biggest win of the year.

### 9. Creighton Bluejays
Another one of the remaining unbeaten teams, the Creighton Bluejays are looking like the second best team in the Big East. The Bluejays have scored 100 points on three separate occasions and have also held teams under 60 in two games. Creighton, led by Marcus Foster, are a serious contender this season and the rest of the country should start to take notice.

### 10. Indiana Hoosiers
Without the loss to Fort Wayne, Indiana would be in the talks for the best team in the country right now. Unfortunately, the top 10 will have to do for now. The Hoosiers are certainly a great team, but all of the teams I have above them either have no losses or have losses to teams that are much better than Fort Wayne. The Hoosiers have plenty of time to prove their worth the rest of the season and I have a feeling they will.

#### 11. Wisconsin Badgers

#### 12. North Carolina Tar Heels

#### 13. Purdue Boilermakers

#### 14. Virginia Cavaliers

#### 15. South Carolina Gamecocks

#### 16. West Virginia Mountaineers

#### 17. Xavier Musketeers

#### 18. Saint Mary's Gaels

#### 19. Arizona Wildcats

#### 20. USC Trojans

#### 21. Butler Bulldogs

#### 22. Notre Dame Fighting Irish

#### 23. Florida State Seminoles

#### 24. Wichita State Shockers

#### 25. Oregon Ducks

##### Next Five:
- Florida Gators
- Cincinnati Bearcats
- Maryland Terrapins
- Michigan State Spartans
- Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders

College basketball is about to start getting really interesting as teams finish up their semesters and start to prepare for conference play. Which teams can continue their success in the non-conference schedule and which teams will get caught looking ahead to league games? The holidays might be dominated by college football bowls, but I for one will be focused on the games taking place on the court.

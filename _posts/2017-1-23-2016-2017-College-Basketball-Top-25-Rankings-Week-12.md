  The top 10 stayed pretty stable but the rest of the top 25 is getting hard to fill in with so many losses in conference play.

I missed the write up for my Top 25 rankings since I was out of town for most of the long weekend. However, when ranking the teams, it was starting to get hard to find teams to fill the last few spots in the Top 25. Now, after another week of conference play where teams just keep beating up on each other, the same issue persists. At this point I'm pretty confident in the 10 best teams in the country right now, but after that, there's about 20 to 30 other teams vying for spots in the Top 25. Here's how I see things after Week 12:

### 1. Villanova Wildcats
Last week I had the Jayhawks in the number one spot, but after another week with the Jayhawks slightly struggling, although still winning, I've rethought my decision and don't think I could pick against the Wildcats unless the game was played at Allen Field House, which it won't be if the two teams meet this season.

### 2. Kansas Jayhawks
They may have a few flaws, but Kansas has yet to lose a game since falling in overtime by 4 to Indiana in the very first game of the season. Kansas has sustained injuries but players have stepped up and they continue to look like they'll win a 13th consecutive Big 12 Title which is mighty impressive. Despite their home winning steak, Allen Field House can't help them when the Jayhawks travel to face Kentucky in Rupp Arena this Saturday as part of the Big 12/SEC Challenge.

### 3. Gonzaga Bulldogs
As the weeks go on, it looks more and more like Gonzaga will enter the NCAA Tournament undefeated and a likely 1-seed. The Bulldogs won't be facing the tests that teams in other major conferences test each week, but there's no way you can say this Gonzaga team isn't one of the best in the country. They did their work in the non-conference schedule and they'll likely be ready to do more work in the NCAA Tournament in March.

### 4. Kentucky Wildcats
Obviously the SEC isn't near as bad as the WCC, but Kentucky is making the conference almost look like it the way they're easily handling every team they face. Kentucky finished last week with a convincing win over South Carolina, who looks to be the clear second best team in the SEC after knocking off Florida right before the game at Rupp.

### 5.Arizona Wildcats
Sean Miller has had this Arizona team playing better and better of the last few weeks. They had just reached my Top 10 last week and then followed it up with a big win on the road against UCLA. To make things even better, Alonzo Trier was finally cleared to play after sitting out for the entire season up to this point for what ended up being due to an illegal substance he took.

### 6. Baylor Bears
The Bears seem to be back on track after suffering their beatdown at the hands of West Virginia and they have another pretty easy week before the showdown with Kansas in Allen Field House next week. Since West Virginia now has 3 losses already, the Bears are looking like they're the only ones that can challenge Kansas and break their Big 12 Title streak.

### 7. Oregon Ducks
Despite the slow start without Dillon Brooks, the Ducks are now on a program record 16 game winning streak and are looking like one of three teams that can vie for the Pac 12 Title. Unfortunately for the Ducks, Dillon Brooks suffered another foot injury. As long as it's nothing serious, Oregon should be in good shape despite having to go on the road once again this week to face Utah and Colorado.

### 8. North Carolina Tar Heels
After starting ACC play off with an awful loss to Georgia Tech, North Carolina has gotten back on track with 6 straight wins to put them in a tie at the top of the conference standings. Florida State might be able to keep up their high level of play, but UNC still is probably my favorite to win the regular season ACC Title at this point.

### 9. Florida State
Speaking of the Seminoles, they're still sitting in my Top 10 with just one conference loss to the Tar Heels on the road. After surviving a brutal week with wins over Notre Dame and Louisville, the Noles now get a slight break with games against Georgia Tech and Syracuse but because there is no easy week in the ACC, both games are on the road.

### 10. UCLA Bruins
UCLA is still one of the more exciting teams to watch, but to really enjoy the Bruins, you'll have to forget that defense is a part of basketball as well. UCLA again showed their weakness in a pretty convincing home loss to Arizona. Lonzo Ball and crew need to bounce back over their next three games on the road against weaker teams before hosting Oregon in two weeks in a game that could help decide the Pac 12 Title.

#### 11. Wisconsin Badgers

#### 12. Louisville Cardinals

#### 13. Purdue Boilermakers

#### 14. Creighton Blue Jays

#### 15. West Virginia Mountaineers

#### 16. Butler Bulldogs

#### 17. Duke Blue Devils

#### 18. Notre Dame Fighting Irish

#### 19. Virginia Cavaliers

#### 20. Cincinnati Bearcats

#### 21. Saint Mary's Gaels

#### 22. South Carolina Gamecocks

#### 23. Xavier Musketeers

#### 24. SMU Mustangs

#### 25. Northwestern Wildcats

##### Next Ten:
- Kansas State Wildcats
- Maryland Terrapins
- Indiana Hoosiers
- UNC Wilmington Seahawks
- Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders
- Texas Tech Red Raiders
- Florida Gators
- TCU Horned Frogs
- Iowa State Cyclones
- Miami Hurricanes

While it probably won't be a close competition this season, I'm glad the Big 12/SEC Challenge is this weekend to give a slight break from the normal conference matchups.

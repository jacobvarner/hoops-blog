### Overview
Georgia returns their two leading scorers from last season in J.J. Frazier and Yante Maten who both averaged over 16 PPG. However, while the two upperclassmen will be a big attribute for the Bulldogs, the supporting cast is also going to have to come together for Georgia to really do some damage in the SEC.

Bigs Derek Ogbeide and Kenny Paul Geno will be a good place to start as they played in 29 and 34 games respectively last season. Ogbeide was second on the team last season with 5.2 RPG behind Maten's 8 RPG and could provide another force on the floor either alongside Maten or while the junior gets some rest. Along with these bigs, another player that could and should step up this season is freshman newcomer, Tyree Crump. Crump was a 4-star, top-100 national recruit and the 4th ranked player in the state of Georgia. Crump will be a key piece alongside J.J. Frazier and should be able to put some additional points on the board for the Bulldogs.

Any team needs depth and an ability to spread the load, but if any two players can carry a team this season in the SEC it might just be J.J. Frazier and Yante Maten. The two were statistically the best players for the Bulldogs last season and they come in this season with even more to accomplish. At over 16 PPG each, both players provided a majority of the scoring for Georgia last year and they'll likely have to do that again. While others can step up in other areas, Georgia doesn't return a lot of scoring outside of Frazier and Maten.

For Georgia to be successful this season, Mark Fox will need Frazier to score close to 20 PPG and dish out close to 5 APG like last year. Maten will have to step his numbers up slightly as well and if he can get closer to averaging a double-double the Bulldogs might be able to inch closer to the top of the SEC.

While Frazier and Maten are certainly good enough to lead Georgia to wins over some of the weaker teams in the SEC, if the Bulldogs want to be one of the better teams in the league, other pieces will have to step up. Outside of Ogbeide, Geno, and Crump it could be anyone, but if no one else steps up the SEC slate could take a toll on the Bulldogs.

Mark Fox has his work cut out for him this season, but building around two very good players should still work out in the end. Georgia has a pretty easy non-conference schedule with a lot of home games which will be ideal for developing a supporting cast and some team chemistry around Frazier and Maten.

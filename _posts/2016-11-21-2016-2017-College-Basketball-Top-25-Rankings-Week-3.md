The first two weekends of college basketball have not disappointed. The first few holiday tournaments have brought some nice matchups and have also highlighted some teams at the same time. We learned a lot about the top teams in the early showcase events in New York and Hawaii which helped with the structuring of the top teams in my rankings this week.

Unfortunately, several of the top teams are still missing key pieces which makes a few of the games played have glaring questions remain. I've taken injuries or other issues into account for my rankings, but with just a week of data to work with, they won't really affect rankings unless players seem to be out for a significant amount of time.

### 1. Kentucky Wildcats
The Wildcats' backcourt of De'Aaron Fox, Malik Monk, and Isaiah Briscoe has proven to be even better than I expected and with Duke going down and Kentucky dismantling Michigan State in Madison Square Garden, they'll take over the top spot in the country.

### 2. Villanova Wildcats
The reigning champions have one of the most impressive road wins so far this year after taking down Purdue in a hostile environment. Following that, the Wildcats also went on to win the Charleston Classic with wins over Western Michigan, Wake Forest, and UCF. Josh Hart is clearly one of the best players in the country and Nova has the supporting cast to make another run at at title this year.

### 3. Kansas Jayhawks
The Jayhawks responded to a narrow overtime loss to a very good Indiana team in Hawaii with an impressive win over Duke in the final seconds. Devonte' Graham and Frank Mason are right there with Kentucky as the best backcourt in the country. If Udoka Azubuike continues to develop and Josh Jackson keeps proving to be one of the best freshman, Kansas could be the best team this season.

### 4. Duke Blue Devils
Duke has been ravaged by injuries so far in this early season, but it's allowed for players like Amile Jefferson and Luke Kennard to really shine. When the three big freshmen come back and if Grayson Allen can get healthy and back to his normal self, this team will probably be even better than everyone thought going into the season.

### 5. North Carolina Tarheels
Unlike the rest of the top teams in the country, North Carolina has yet to face a real challenge minus traveling to Hawaii and picking up a win. The key wins can come later, but for now, the Tarheels have beaten each of the decent teams on their early schedule by big margins and they'll continue to have the veterans to keep this team as one of the best in the ACC and in the country.

### 6. Indiana Hoosiers
I had Indiana in my preseason top 25 like most people, but also like most people, I didn't expect the Hoosiers to be quite as good as they've been so far in this early season. If Tom Crean has taught me anything, I know not to get too far onboard the Indiana hype train, but for now, James Blackmon has been outstanding and Indiana already has one of the best wins with their overtime victory over Kansas in Hawaii.

### 7. Arizona Wildcats
Arizona has also been dealt their fair share of injuries and other issues. Despite losing Ray Smith and playing without Alonzo Trier, the Wildcats still managed to knock off Michigan State in the first game of the year and have dominated in their next two games. There are reports that Trier is coming back this week, and if he does, Arizona will likely continue to rise in my rankings.

### 8. Xavier Musketeers
Going to overtime against Missouri caused me to have some concerns for Xavier, but I doubt the Musketeers will shoot 2-22 from deep again this season. JP Macura has been playing really well in the Tire Pros Invitational and if Trevon Bluitt and the other key players for Xavier can find their game the Musketeers will resume their place as the top challenger to Villanova in the Big East.

### 9. Oregon Ducks
Oregon, playing without their best player by far, suffered an early road loss at Baylor. The Ducks then bounced back with a convincing win over Valparaiso. When Dillon Brooks comes back, Oregon will be significantly better and will make the climb back into the top 5 among the best teams in the country this year.

### 10. Saint Mary's Gaels
Villanova's win at Purdue is right there with it, but Saint Mary's win at Dayton might be the most impressive road win this season, especially considering where Saint Mary's was going in compared to Villanova. The Gaels, with each starter returning from last season, are one of the best offensive teams in the country and the ball movement is a true pleasure to watch.

#### 11. Louisville Cardinals

#### 12. UCLA Bruins

#### 13. Virginia Cavaliers

#### 14. Wisconsin Badgers

#### 15. Gonzaga Bulldogs

#### 16. Iowa State Cyclones

#### 17. Creighton Bluejays

#### 18. Texas Longhorns

#### 19. Syracuse Orange

#### 20. West Virginia Mountaineers

#### 21. Michigan State Spartans

#### 22. Michigan Wolverines

#### 23. Wichita State Shockers

#### 24. Purdue Boilermakers

#### 25. Rhode Island Rams

##### Next Five:
- Florida State Seminoles
- North Carolina State Wolfpack
- California Bears
- Cincinnati Bearcats
- Dayton Flyers

This week we have a full week of loaded holiday tournaments so we'll get to see a majority of the top teams play in neutral environments on short rest against top talent. To me this is the best measurement of teams. There weren't too many teams exposed in the first week, but with tougher games coming, we could see a few teams drop or make significant climbs in the poll.

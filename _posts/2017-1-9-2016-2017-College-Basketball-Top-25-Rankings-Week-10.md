Villanova finally went down as Butler held on to knock of the Wildcats in Hinkle Fieldhouse. With Villanova finally going down, it leaves the door open for a new number one team. A case could be made for Kansas, but Baylor lands in the top spot in my poll. It's hard to move Villanova far down when they've been the clear top team for me for a few weeks now and a close win on the road against a good team doesn't change that too much. However, there are a handful of others at the top that certainly deserve to move up.

Conference play has been off to a great start with tons of craziness in the Big 12 and the ACC while the Big Ten and the SEC seem to be pretty unpredictable. With so many close games and upsets, it's getting harder and harder each week to decide which teams deserve to be slotted into the last few spots in my Top 25 as well as the 10 extra teams that I rank each week.

### 1. Baylor Bears
Baylor got two scares against Iowa State and Oklahoma State after Villanova went down but the Bears survived both games to pick up two more top 35 KenPom wins which gives them 9 top 100 wins and 6 top 50 wins for one of, if not the, best resume in college basketball at this point.

### 2. Kansas Jayhawks
Kansas walked away with a last second win over Kansas State at home, and the Jayhawks are hanging right behind Baylor waiting for them to slip up as they search for their 13th straight Big 12 title this year.

### 3. UCLA Bruins
Honestly, it's a shame that all of UCLA's games are going to be late night games most likely on the Pac 12 Network from here on out. More people deserve to see this talented team that continues to get better it seems as they discover their strengths and continue to build chemistry.

### 4. Villanova Wildcats
I was tempted to only drop the Wildcats to 3 after their loss on the road to Butler but UCLA has done enough and looked good enough to stay above for now. Villanova is still one of my favorites to go deep in March and with the hardest part of their Big East schedule over with, they could start yet another long winning streak.

### 5. Gonzaga Bulldogs
Gonzaga may not lose another game, but because they play in a week conference they also might not move any higher in my poll. Gonzaga is definitely a good team and deserving of a top 5 spot, but without competition to keep testing them it's really hard to justify them not getting jumped by other top teams that continually prove themselves in conference play.

### 6. Kentucky Wildcats
Yes, the SEC is bad once again this year but Kentucky has already beaten two of the teams that were projected to finish near the top and have won all three league games by more than 23 points. At this point it's just a matter of SEC teams trying to keep Kentucky under 90 points which they've only done 4 times this season.

### 7. Creighton Bluejays
Creighton didn't fall much after narrowly losing to then number one Villanova and so now after a week of other teams in the top 10 losing, the Bluejays are climbing back up. After Villanova there seems to be a 3 team race for second in the Big East and each of these teams can give the Wildcats issues the rest of the year.

### 8. Duke Blue Devils
The Virginia Tech loss looks a little worse now but the Blue Devils have still responded with two big wins to prepare for a tough stretch against Florida State and Louisville on the road that has now been made even tougher as Coach K will be out after surgery and they now are possibly missing Amile Jefferson.

### 9. Florida State
Speaking of the Seminoles, when the Blue Devils come to town on Tuesday, it will not be a top 10 matchup in my eyes. Florida State followed up last weeks big wins over Wake Forest and Virginia with a beatdown of Virginia Tech. It might not stick for long, but if the Seminoles can also knock off Duke, they'll certainly be deserving of a top 10 vote.

### 10. Arizona Wildcats
Arizona hasn't been in my top 10 since Week 3, but the Wildcats have continued to win games and hold on despite missing several key players along the way. They're still missing Allonzo Trier, but when he finally returns the Pac 12 should watch out. They both looked down earlier in the year but it now appears both Arizona and Oregon will be looking to challenge UCLA at the top out West.

#### 11. West Virginia Mountaineers

#### 12. Xavier Musketeers

#### 13. Oregon Ducks

#### 14. Purdue Boilermakers

#### 15. North Carolina Tar Heels

#### 16. Butler Bulldogs

#### 17. Louisville Cardinals

#### 18. Wisconsin Badgers

#### 19. Saint Mary's Gaels

#### 20. Florida Gators

#### 21. Virginia Cavaliers

#### 22. Cincinnati Bearcats

#### 23. Notre Dame Fighting Irish

#### 24. Iowa State Cyclones

#### 25. Minnesota Golden Gophers

##### Next Ten:
- Texas Tech Red Raiders
- USC Trojans
- Clemson Tigers
- SMU Mustangs
- South Carolina Gamecocks
- Virginia Tech Hokies
- Kansas State Wildcats
- Indiana Hoosiers
- Wichita State Shockers
- Michigan State Spartans

As Auburn struggles through the beginning of their SEC schedule, at least I get to enjoy the fun of college basketball around the rest of the country. It's getting harder to rank these teams, but that only means there's tons of good basketball being played.
